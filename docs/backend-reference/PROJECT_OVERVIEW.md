## 🛒 What is ShopWise?

**ShopWise Pakistan** is an intelligent web-based shopping assistant specifically designed for Pakistani consumers navigating the rapidly growing but fragmented e-commerce landscape. It's a comprehensive platform that empowers users to make informed, cost-effective, and confident purchasing decisions by aggregating, analyzing, and presenting product information from multiple online marketplaces.

Think of it as your **smart shopping companion** that does all the heavy lifting—comparing prices across platforms, tracking price history, predicting future price trends, analyzing seller trustworthiness, and alerting you when prices drop—all in one place.

### 🎯 In Simple Terms:
Instead of manually checking Daraz, PriceOye, Telemart, Homeshopping, and other sites to find the best deal on a laptop or mobile phone, ShopWise does it for you instantly. It also tells you if the price will likely drop soon, whether the seller is trustworthy, and sends you alerts when your desired product hits your target price.

## 🚨 The Problem We're Solving

The Pakistani e-commerce market has grown exponentially, but it comes with significant challenges for consumers:

### **1. Price Inconsistency & Confusion**
- Same products have drastically different prices across platforms (sometimes 10-30% variation)
- Hidden charges, shipping costs, and unclear warranty terms make price comparison difficult
- No centralized platform exists to compare prices in real-time

### **2. Time-Consuming Manual Research**
- Consumers waste hours visiting multiple websites to find the best deal
- Price tracking requires manually checking websites daily or weekly
- No historical data available to determine if current prices are good deals

### **3. Trust & Reliability Issues**
- Scams, fake reviews, and unreliable sellers are common
- No unified system to evaluate seller trustworthiness
- Difficulty distinguishing authentic reviews from fake ones

### **4. Lack of Predictive Insights**
- No way to know if prices will drop during upcoming sales
- Missing the best buying opportunities due to lack of price trend analysis
- No personalized alerts for price drops on desired products

### **5. Limited Accessibility**
- Most platforms are English-only, excluding a large portion of Pakistani consumers
- No local language support (Urdu/Pashto) for comparison tools
- Complex interfaces unsuitable for non-tech-savvy users
